# CatChat
A Custom Chat Server and Client mainly for personal use, aiming to have decentralization of servers, end-to-end Encryption, and attempting to have Feature Parody with the likes of Discord.

Currently still in the Proof of Concept phases of trying to figure out how parts might work.
This is also presently a solo project in my free time to progress may be slow.

Planned Features:
Ability to have Chat bots in channels if desired
Modularity of the Server and Client
  Examples: 
    Running parts of the Server Application on multiple machines
    Adding Functionality to the Client or Server, such as a Display Name Drop down or built in Dice Rolls for DND style RPs
Key Based Authentication
Optional Encrypted Logs
End-to-End Encrypted (The Server can't see any logs or content in transit)
Android App and Cross Platform Client
